### Digitized pre-digital astrophysics literature using NASA's Astrophysics Dataset System. Streamlined the project with advanced machine learning models using Detectron2, Sklearn, and TensorFlow to automate, and enhanced the data filtering pipeline by 82%. Executed functionalities by performing binary and multi-class classification on image datasets, resulting in an overall operational accuracy of 70%.

### Some more information on the project:

### This Research Project is based on the Digitization of Archival Scientific Documents. It is important to 'digitize' scientific literature which was published in the pre-digital scientific era(that is, prior to 1997). The dataset comes from the Astrophysics Data System(ADS), an online 
database of around eight million astronomy and physics-related research papers. The second and major part involves Document Image Analysis using object detection algorithms. The project involves the detection of different classes like 'text,' 'title,' 'list,' 'table,' and 'figure' that can be detected accurately by the ML models.

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models used: 

### The major part involves Document Image Analysis using object detection algorithms. The project involves the detection of different classes like 'text,' 'title,' 'list,' 'table,' and 'figure' that can be detected accurately by the ML models. The image annotation process needs to be fully automated, the less use of human annotators, the better. Machine learning classification methods/algorithms are used to detect text and figures on these research papers and extract information from them. Citizen science is also involved in this method. The project involves creating a pipeline where datasets would be developed and put on the Zooniverse site (open source), which astronomers, researchers or students can use for their research work. There are 10s of thousands of research papers that need to be digitized in this way.
